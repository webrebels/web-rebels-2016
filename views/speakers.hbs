            <h4 class="impact">How Long On That Ticket? - Proven Recipes That Enhance Collaboration</h4>
            <p>
            Programming can often feel like a solitarypursuit – it’s just you and your computer against the world – it’s easy to forget that you are working alongside a team of people to accomplish a project as a group.  Professional cooks do this every day, sometimes twice a day with shorter timeframes to feed hungry patrons. In this talk, Juan Pablo & Patricia sauté their way through communication recipes used every night in the fast paced world of cooks and kitchens to support each other as they collaborate on making great food. Let’s explore how engineering teams can implement them to whip up better software.

            <p>
            The Progressive Web is here, and it means our web apps will escape the browser tab and power the applications running on our phones, TVs and watches. But what does that mean for the developer tools we use every day? In this talk I’ll share our view on web tooling and the work we do to make it easier and more productive to build for the web.

            <p>
            What do you imagine when you hear "letter press" or "Typesetting"? You might think of Gutenberg Bible or hip print shop in Brooklyn, but Typesetting machine attracted many engineer's creative curiosity long before everyone had own home printer or a website.
            </p>
            <p>
            Typesetting machine was invented out of do "not repeat yourself" momentarily, and one of 1st machinery to be automated. Before we had computer screen, programmers were making domain specific language to print an image with code. Did you know Unix was used to operate typesetting machine in 70s? Ken Thompson even hacked on typesetter to create Emoji for his chess machine book! The base concept of the webpage we deal with everyday - using computer to format document - was once a exciting research field. Modern software like WYSIWIG editor would not exist if these creative minds didn't put ink on their fingers. Let's look back the part of computing history that allowed us to have HTML, web fonts and emoji and more!

            <h4 class="impact">Real time front-end alchemy</h4>
            <p>
            As new features are added to the Web platform, the kind of experiences we can build become amazingly interactive and immersive--a huge leap forward from the static document based web of yore!
            </p>
            <p>
            Nowadays we can access webcams and play 3D audio and graphics, all in real time and in the browser, but there was a missing piece: capturing and encoding! Most solutions involved either sending data to servers or porting C++ encoders to JavaScript, none of which were particularly efficient or desirable for privacy or performance reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thankfully there is a better way: the new and shiny MediaCapture API, and in this talk you will learn all about it. Streams will be no strangers to you anymore, and you might even be tempted to cross a few of them---just for fun!
