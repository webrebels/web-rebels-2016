    <p>Coming to a city for the first time you might not know where to go and what to see. We've put together this short list of things and places we appreciate in our beloved city.

Most of the places are located close to the conference venue and hotel in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnerl%C3%B8kka">the borough of Grünerløkka</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="getting_around_oslo" class="ratherloud-heading">Getting around Oslo</h2>
    <p>We suggest you <a href="https://ruter.no/en/tickets/mobile-ticket-app/">download the ticketing app</a> for your mobile phone. You register your credit card and then you can easily purchase tickets for the metro, tram, bus and boats in and around Oslo. There are no more paper tickets for mass transit in Oslo and to get a physical card involves quite a bit of hassle and paperwork, so use the app.</p>
    <p>Taking a taxi is of course possible, but it is pretty expensive and on weekends and nights extra fees are added. So we suggest you help save the environment and your money by taking mass transit while staying in Oslo</p>

        <p>If you've brought the kids along for the conference you might let them check out the local activity center Hopp i Havet (which roughly translates to Jump in the sea). It is a huge building with long slides, trampolines, climbing towers and all kinds of obstacles. It's got loads of fun things all in an atmosphere of being at the bottom of the sea.<br>
