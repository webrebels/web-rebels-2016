    <h2 class="ratherloud-heading">Getting to Oslo</h2>
    <p>Traveling to Oslo has never been cheaper in the history of the Web Rebels! The Norwegian currency has taken a dip which means travelling from outside Norway is cheaper than ever.
      Below you can see some of the options available for you.</p>

    <h3>Flights</h3>
    <p>You can travel to Norway cheaply (No, Really)! <a target="_blank" href="http://norwegian.no/en/">Norwegian</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flysas.com/en/uk/">SAS</a>
    both have lower priced tickets on sale which
    you can get if you make reservations early.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://norwegian.no/en/">Norwegian</a>
    tends to be the cheapest option; check out their
    <a href="http://www.norwegian.no/en/flight/lowfare/?D_City=LGW&A_City=OSL&TripType=2&D_Month=201305&R_Month=201305&AdultCount=1&ChildCount=0&InfantCount=0">calendar
    app for cheapest flights in the period</a> (this URL links
    to flights from London to Oslo). SAS generally offers a more comfortable flight, but
    Norwegian offers free in-flight Wi-fi.

    <h3 id="to_and_from_oslo_airport">To and from Oslo Airport</h3>
    <p>Whatever you do, don’t grab a taxi from the
    airport. It's a really long and expensive ride. A
    cheap way of getting to Oslo is by the airport express bus (either <a href="http://www.nor-way.no/?lang=en_GB">Nor-Way Bussexpress</a> or <a href="http://flybussen.no/en">SAS Flybussen</a>, but <a href="http://www.flytoget.no/eng/">the
    airport express train</a> (called Flytoget in Norwegian) is also quite reasonable, and is by
    far the most convenient.  The cheapest options is to take the <a href="https://www.nsb.no/en/timetables/timetables?periodStartDate=&fromStation=Oslo+Lufthavn&toStation=Oslo+S&departure=2&monday=monday&tuesday=tuesday&wednesday=wednesday&saturday=saturday&sunday=sunday&departureTimeFrom=&departureTimeTo=&returnTimeFrom=&returnTimeTo=&allDay=allDay">local train service NSB</a>, which is about 90 NOKs. It might not be as fast as the other options, but it is the cheapest.<br>
    You'll want to get off the train at
    Oslo Central Station, where you'll find taxis and public
    transport aplenty. If you're staying at the conference
    hotel, see the guide for getting to the venue above.

    <p>
    If your company’s paying anyway why not splurge? Unlike most other things in Norway, hotels in Oslo are
    surprisingly cheap. You can stay at the 5 star
    <a href="http://www.radissonblu.com/plazahotel-oslo">Radisson
    BLU Plaza</a>, located in the heart of the city, right next
    to all the public transport you’ll need to get to the venue,
    for a lot less than you’d expect.
    If you want to go all out on the expense account,
    though, there’s always
    <a href="http://www.hotelcontinental.no/flash.aspx?ID=338&AreaID=2">Hotel
    Continental</a>. We expect that if you can afford to stay
    there, you won't mind having to get to the venue by taxi.
